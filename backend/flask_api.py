    a NumPy array, normalizes the pixel values, and returns the preprocessed image.

    that you want to preprocess. This function loads the image from the specified path, resizes it to a
    target size of 64x64 pixels, converts it to a NumPy array, expands its dimensions to include

    array with shape (1, 64, 64, 3) where the image has been resized to 64x64 pixels, converted to an
    array, expanded dimensions to include batch size, and normalized by dividing by 255.0.
